## What is Permission To View?
The [Summary Care Record](http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/scr) and other local shared records are regularly used by urgent & emergency care services when providing unplanned care to patients. In almost all cases the consent to view these records is given by the patient at the time of the encounter (i.e. the clinician looking after the patient will ask the patient for permission to view their medical records). This is often referred to as **'Permission To View'** or **'PTV'**.

The nature of the integrated urgent care system is that often there are multiple care providing organisations involved with a single episode of care for the patient. A patient will have a poor experience of the service if each organisation involved in their episode of care has to repeat the question about having consent to view their medical records.

### Sharing Permission To View
A better experience for both patients and clinicians, it should only be necessary to ask the patient for their permission to view their medical records once at the beginning of their encounter with the integrated urgent care system. If the patient needs to interact with other urgent care service during their encounter, their consent should be automatically communicated between those services alongside the rest of the information about their encounter.

### How is Permission To View shared?
The latest version of the **NHS 111 Domain Message Specification** includes a section within ITK messages which allows a referring organisation (e.g. an NHS 111 service) to communicate a patient's Permission To View to a receiving organisation (e.g. an out of hours service, a clinical hub, an ambulance service).
