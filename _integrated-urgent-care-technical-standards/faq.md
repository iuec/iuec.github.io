## Frequently Asked Questions

### ITK Messaging
*Q: Do I have to support the **Nullify** interaction in my system?*

A: No - the Nullify interaction was excluded from the Urgent Care implementation of ITK Messaging as it was not deemed to be safe enough to cancel a pending interaction for a patient without human intervention.
