title: Non-functional Requirements
category: NHS111 IMT Standards
---

The following requirements are expected to be implemented by all suppliers involved in the NHS 111 pilots. This list is likely to grow during the development of the NHS 111 pilot solution.

## 5.1 NFR.1 Flexible Architecture
The system SHOULD be designed flexibly, so as to accommodate change.

The systems and interfaces comprising the NHS Care Record Services will change over time, as new policies and functionality are introduced, and the operational environment evolves. This will require that suppliers are able to modify, activate and deactivate system and user interfaces, and the operational behaviour of the system, or parts thereof.

## 5.2 NFR.2 Support for Multiple Versions of Message Definitions
The system MUST be designed in such a way as to support multiple versions of message definitions as receiver and sender of NHS 111 messages to and from other suppliers/organisations.

## 5.3 NFR.3 Availability
The Availability of the system MUST be appropriate for the environment in which it is being deployed, taking into consideration its intended usage.

The method for calculating the target Availability of the system MUST be defined, and the required target Availability MUST be documented.

The actual Availability of the system MUST be monitored.

Failure to meet the required target Availability of the system must be addressed through service improvements.

## 5.4 NFR. 4 Open Standards
Suppliers SHOULD adopt Open Standards wherever possible for the development, testing and deployment of accredited systems that will connect to any of the Spine Services.

Across the NHS, Open Standards will be applied where applicable, and suppliers are likely to accommodate change most easily if they have adhered to this requirement.

## 5.5 NFR.5.001 Response Times
The system MUST enable users to work efficiently.

System design must take account of the user experience and ensure that the introduction of NHS 111 functionality enhances, rather than degrades, the user experience.

Systems should make use of appropriate current technology and best practice, and take into consideration the expected response time characteristics of using web services.
